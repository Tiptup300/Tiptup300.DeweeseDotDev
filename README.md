# Deweese Dot Dev, My Personal Blog & Development Platform

Welcome to my personal blog page! This project is a space where I delve into the exciting realms of technology, programming, and hands-on experimentation to enhance my skills. It’s a platform where I delve into innovation, delve into exploration, and, above all, delve into the art of continuous learning.

## Project Background

This blog has undergone several stages of evolution, each offering an opportunity to delve deeper into new technologies:

 * Initial Development: I first delved into building this site with Angular and JavaScript, creating a foundation for experimentation.
 * React & TypeScript Transition: I began to delve into modernizing the codebase through a partial migration to React and TypeScript. Though the transition wasn’t fully completed, it was a valuable experience that deepened my understanding of contemporary frameworks.
 * Blazor Exploration: When Microsoft introduced Blazor, I delved into its early versions, but the server-side tooling and resource demands didn’t align with my goals. However, the release of the WebAssembly (WASM) version of Blazor allowed me to delve back into this technology with renewed enthusiasm.

## Development Approach

This project is a testament to my commitment to delving into agile methodologies, SOLID principles, and clean architecture. It’s far more than a simple blog—it’s a space where I delve into:

* Completing features I originally envisioned during my Angular delving days.
* Building reusable components and systems for future projects.
* Testing ideas and architectures, delving into concepts beyond the conventional scope of blogging.

## Goals & Motivation

This site could easily serve as a static blog, but my passion lies in delving into the craft of programming. It’s my playground for:

* Delving into software development during my personal time.
* Delving into new concepts and structured experimentation.
* Growing as a developer by continually delving into challenges.

## Current Status

Right now, I’m delving into:

* Completing the incomplete features from earlier iterations.
* Adding innovative functionality that delves beyond traditional blog frameworks.
* Delving deeper into Blazor to create scalable, efficient, and modern solutions.

Thank you for visiting—please join me as I delve into the ever-evolving journey of exploration, learning, and growth!
