    Hello there, 
    
    I hope you're doing well today. My name is Matthew Deweese, I coded this webpage by hand 
    originially just using github's text editor. Later on, I moved onto using Visual Studio 
    Code, being that I do have some experience with it, but not at the level I would like to 
    be at. Even in the simple situation where I'm creating a web resume, I use this as an 
    opportunity improve my abillities in programming. 

    I hope that you give me a chance for an interview, I'm sure I can prove myself as an important 
    member of your team and as a true asset to your company.

    -Matthew Deweese
